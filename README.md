# Vigenère’s cipher

A program called vigenere that enables you to encrypt messages using Vigenère’s cipher written in C
[Pseuodocode](pseuodocode.txt)

## Task

Create a program that transforms the plaintext to ciphertext based on the argument provided by the user
[CS50 2019 - Vigenere](https://lab.cs50.io/cs50/labs/2019/x/vigenere/)

## Criteria

The program must receive a word argument and ignore non-Alphabet char

## Functionality

This program asks for the argument and applies Vigenere cryptosystem on a plaintext, thus generating a ciphertext

## Run Locally

Run this command git clone https://github.com/guiaramos/vigenere-cryptosystem.git.
Make sure your PC is able to compile Clang
Run "make vigenere" and then "./vigenere"
