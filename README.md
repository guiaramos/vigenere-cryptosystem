# Credit Card Validation

This is a simple program to transform a plaintext to ciphertext using Caesar cryptosystem written in C
[Pseuodocode](pseuodocode.txt)

## Task

Create a program that transforms the plaintext to ciphertext based on the argument provided by the user
[CS50 2019 - Caesar](https://lab.cs50.io/cs50/labs/2019/x/caesar/)

## Criteria

The program must receive a non-negative argument and ignore non-Alphabet char


## Functionality

This program asks for the argument and applies Caesar cryptosystem on a plaintext, thus generating a ciphertext

## Run Locally

Run this command git clone https://github.com/guiaramos/caesar-cryptosystem.git.
Make sure your PC is able to compile Clang
Run "make Caesar" and then "./caesar"
